<h4> XHTML vs HTML5 </h4>

What is the difference between XHTML and HTML5?
HTML5 is the new version with all of the changes
and XHTML is a combination of HTML4 and XML 1.0 (the older version).

<h6>Absolute vs Relative URL's </h6>
<p>
What is the difference between absolute and relative url's?
Absolute URL's contain more information. However relative URL's are
more convenient because they are shorter and more portable.
